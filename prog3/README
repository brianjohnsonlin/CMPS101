We used random.org to generate these test files.
Test File : # of keys | insertionSort | heapSort

prog3data2: 50000     |  3.95 sec     | 0.02 sec
prog3data3: 10000     |  0.16 sec     | 0.00 sec
prog3data4: 100000    | 15.60 sec     | 0.05 sec

By comparing the two sorting algorithms with increasing an number of numbers,
we concluded that heapSort is WAY more efficient than insertionSort. Yup.
